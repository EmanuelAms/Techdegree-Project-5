# Techdegree-Project-5
My 5th Techdegree Project : Public API Requests.

This project updates a webpage dynamically with asynchronous code.
It requests public data on an external API (https://randomuser.me/),
then displays it on the page by dynamically adding HTML elements through the DOM.

The project makes use of the fetch() method to make a request to the API url and get the data.
The data consists of 12 random users which change everytime the page reloads.
The project makes use of the json() method which creates an object with the response that is retrieved from this request.

The other methods used go back to previous Techdegree units : DOM elements, event listeners, regex methods.
